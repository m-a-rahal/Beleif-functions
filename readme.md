I've implemented the exercise 1 with the toolbox https://github.com/reineking/pyds

execute 'exercise1.py' to see the results,
I'm still trying to figure out why the weight of conflict (K) 
and the results after combining (with normalization and all)
are close but different form the teacher's results !

other than that, it's all implemented there
